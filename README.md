This code example shows me using React's Context API to trigger a modal on another component when clicking a Check Out Button. In this example, the Check Out Button is inside a Page Container, triggering a Modal nested inside the Header Container.

This code example also shows the use of Apollo GraphQL, Styled Components, and other libraries used in order to achieve the product and business objective.
